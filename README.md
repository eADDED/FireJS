## Install

install using **yarn** or **npm**

**yarn**

```bash
$ yarn add @eadded/firejs react react-dom
```

**npm**

```bash
$ npm install @eadded/firejs react react-dom
```

## Quick Start

Make dir `src/pages` in project root. This dir will contain all the pages required for our brand-new hello world website.

Make a file **404.js** in the dir. This file will be the 404 page of our website.

```jsx
export default () => {  
  return (
    <div>
        <p>Welcome to 404</p>
    </div>  
  )
}
```

Add the following **script(s)** to **package.json**

```json 
"scripts": {
    "dev": "firejs",  
}
```

Now run using **yarn** or **npm**

**yarn**
```bash
$ yarn run dev
```
**npm**
```bash
$ npm run dev
```
Navigate to `http://localhost:5000` and there it says `Welcome to 404`.

*To change server **PORT** set env variable **PORT** to the required value*

**Note:** 404 page is mandatory
