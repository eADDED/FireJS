# Features

+ **Fast WebPages** FireJSX preloads external chunks such as react, react-dom and provides a Link Component which helps preload in-project pages beforehand for faster and snappier websites.

+ **Node interface for on the fly rendering (SSR)** FireJSX provides an `export-fly` mechanism which extracts the min chunks required for SSR and bundles it into a single unit, which when combined with the CustomRenderer helps render FireJSX pages on the fly. You can render them on a serverless function or on a full-fledged Server.

+ **Dev friendly CLI interface** FireJSX provides a fast and dev friendly CLI interface.

+ **Plugins** FireJSX provides a rich plugin API which helps users to develop or install required features as per their need. Customize webpack or your routes. Use plugins to load Data From Anywhere. FireJSX pulls in data from any data source, whether itâ€™s Markdown files, a headless CMS like Contentful or WordPress, or a REST or GraphQL API. Use plugins to load and pass on data to your pages as props.

+ **Routes** FireJSX allows any page to have multiple routes without rewriting the same code a thousand times. FireJSX routes are similar to file-system dirs, so you never get a page conflict when pushing the site to a static host.

+ **Highly customizable project structure and webpack** FireJSX don't bind you to a fixed thought. If you don't like something, then just change it.
